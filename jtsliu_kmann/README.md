Our current goal is to evaluate neighborhoods in Boston, and determine if a
neighborhood has become more "dangerous" over time. Another possibility we hope
to keep in mind is to be able to rate an area or all areas based on some metrics, and
then if there is some business/building you are looking to establish, you can see
the most prospectable area for this building. Currently we are looking at the following
data to try and solve this problem:

1. Crime data from city of Boston: https://data.cityofboston.gov/Public-Safety/Crime-Incident-Reports/7cdf-6fgx

This dataset was chosen because we believe it represents a pretty strong correlation
to the dangerousness of a neighborhood - high violent crime is probably a dangerous
area.

2. Liquor license data from city of Boston: https://data.cityofboston.gov/dataset/Liquor-Licenses/hda6-fnsh

This dataset is a bit of an experiment. Perhaps it is the case that in areas with easily
available alcohol, there is high crime rate. In particular, violent crime related to
alcohol - this would be a cause of a neighborhood becoming more dangerous potentially.

3. Property Assessment
