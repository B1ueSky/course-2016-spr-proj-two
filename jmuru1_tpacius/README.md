# course-2016-spr-proj-one
Project repository for the first project in the Spring 2016 iteration of the Data Mechanics course at Boston University.

We chose to work with the Zipcar's datasets on Boston Reversations and Boston Member Counts as well as the City's Property Valuation dataset. We believe that these datasets can be combined together via their Postal Codes to determine if there is a correlation between Zipcar subscriptions numbers, frequency of Zipcar trips in a neighborhood, and value of property in particular neighborhoods. The identification of meaningful intersection between the three datasets could potentially be useful in identifying potential locations for new general purpose parking lots, MTBA stop locations, Zipcar lot expansions and more.

Our apitest script uses our own City of Boston Socrata api key to gather raw data to insert in the db.
