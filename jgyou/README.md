Needle Dropoff Site Analysis in Boston

##The Importance of Safe Needle and Syringe Disposal

The safe disposal of needles, syringes, and other sharp medical devices ("sharps") is a public health issue. Americans annually use [over 3 billion needles and sharps] (http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/HomeHealthandConsumer/ConsumerProducts/Sharps/) for medical purposes (e.g. for diabetes, allergies, cancer) at home. Workers such as recycling plant workers, waste haulers, and janitors can be injured by [improperly disposed sharps] (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/bbp/disposal.html). Household members, children, and pets can also be harmed if sharps are disposed of improperly around the home. This can potentially spread infections including [Hepatitis B and C and HIV] (Http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/HomeHealthandConsumer/ConsumerProducts/Sharps/).

Nationwide, there are [certain programs] (http://www.safeneedledisposal.org/general-information/types-of-programs/), such as suppervised community collection points, mail-back programs, hazardous waste collection sites, and needle exchange programs, that exist to provide safe means for sharps disposal.

In several states and cities, bans have been imposed on sharp disposal in household waste. In Massachusetts specifically, the disposal of medical sharps in household waste has been illegal [since 2012] (http://news.mit.edu/2012/new-law-on-sharps-disposal-goes-in-effect-july-1-2012). Massachusetts residents use an estimated [2 million needles per week] (http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/docs/dph/environmental/sanitation/faq-needle-disposal.pdf).
