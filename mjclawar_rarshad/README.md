We are interested in evaluating Boston neighborhoods/properties based on a variety of parameters. Important parameters
include incidents of crime and proximity to facilities such as schools and public transportation. We will ideally
include additional relevant data sets such as emergency response times, demographic data, and more. We will come up with
a value metric based on our data. We will then compare our value metric to actual property assessment data and observe
the following:
    -What parameters strongly influence property value?
    -Does our model agree with actual property data?
